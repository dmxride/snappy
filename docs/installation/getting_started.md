# Getting Started with Snappy

Snappy is like those cheap brand ripoffs. It currently aims for projects which rely on [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and [react-native-navigation](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/#/).

Snappy aims to ease the mobile development process by abstracting some of the most repetitive and common processes such as associating [internationalization](/i18n) to a project, connecting to a [store and persisting data](/logic), providing [themes](/themes), adding [native navigation](/navigation) solutions, creating [forms](/forms) and providing [native components](/components) such as toasters, popups, modals, bottom drawers and much more.

The following libraries already come bundled and are integrated with Snappy so there is no need to install them:

  * **@react-native-community/async-storage**: ^1.7.1
  * **i18next**: ^19.1.0
  * **react-native-localize**: ^1.3.3
  * **react-redux**: ^7.1.1
  * **redux-logger**: ^3.0.6
  * **redux-persist**: ^6.0.0
  * **redux-saga**: ^1.1.1


In order to use Snappy you must first configure your [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) project to use [react-native-navigation](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/#/).
